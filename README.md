# AI-Dermatology-DenseNet201
AI-powered dermatology system for multi-class skin disease classification using DenseNet201. Achieved 98% training accuracy, 96.4% validation accuracy, and 94.6% test accuracy. Includes experiments with CNNs, ResNet, EfficientNet, and class balancing.



# AI Dermatology: Skin Disease Classification

This project is our **Graduation Project** focused on building an AI-based dermatology system capable of accurately classifying different skin diseases from dermoscopic images.  

We developed a **mobile application** backed by a deep learning model (**DenseNet201**) integrated into a database for real-time classification. The system aims to assist in **early detection** and **diagnosis support** for dermatologists and healthcare providers.
